                         Firmware Revision History

================================================================================

v1.0  20-01-2025
````````````````
Minimal functionality... No OLED user-interface, no CV control. 
Sound engine tested OK. MIDI control tested OK.

v1.1  xx-01-2025 -- WIP (not released)
````````````````
Added patch presets...  total: 24
Imported improvements done in full-featured Sigma-6 (PIC32MX).

v1.2  13-02-2025
````````````````
Added code module to support control panel (UI with OLED, etc).
Added MIDI Control Change message types for config & patch params).
Added functions to support CV control mode.
Added 'SETUP MENU' screen to select param to adjust...(cool feature!)
Added many more UI screen functions (param settings).
Added CV option to quantize (or not) pitch to nearest semitone.
Added Master Tune parameter and GUI screen function to adjust.

v1.3  15-02-2025
````````````````
Fixed bug in 'ENV Decay' setup screen... data shown incorrectly.
Fixed bug in 'Reverb' setup screen.... 'Cancel' malfunction.
Fixed bug in 'Master Tune' setup screen... 'Cancel' malfunction.

Added feature: Display brightness is adjustable using pot in 'Home' screen.

v1.4  25-02-2025  (= v1.3R)
````````````````
Added macro in header file "M0-synth-defs.h" (line 13) to compile for either
Adafruit M0 or (RoboDyn) SAMD21-M0-Mini board.  This is necessary because
the SAMD21-M0-Mini board is not 100% I/O compatible with the Adafruit M0.

v1.5  28-02-2025
````````````````
Modified 'control mode' to switch automatically between MIDI and CV input...
Mode is initialized at power-on/reset according to jumper JP1 setting;
if MIDI 'Note-On' message rec'd, control mode switches to MIDI;
if GATE input transitions from Low to High, mode switches to CV.

Reduced filter time-constant on CV1 input signal to speed up response to
changes in pitch. (Not fully tested yet.)

Added MIDI message support for Master Tune and Ampld Envelope (ENV1) param's.

Added UI screen to allow 'CV Base Note' setting, range 24 (C1) to 55 (G3),
accessible via 'CV Options' in SETUP menu. (Also settable via MIDI msg.)

Minor cosmetic changes to a few UI screens.

v1.6  07-03-2025
````````````````
Modified CV1 CAL screen to show both uncalibrated reading (using 5100mV FS) and 
adjusted reading (using config param).  If correctly calibrated, the adjusted
reading will equal the reference voltage applied to the CV1 input (±5 mV).

Improved Preset 01: "Electric Piano #1".  Added presets 25..28.

Fixed a bug in Reverb UI setting... (need to re-calculate variables).


v1.7  12-03-2025 -- WIP
```````````````````````
Fixed a bug in CV Mode (?) -- Delayed (or no) response to GATE signal.

Added support for 24LC08 EEPROM to store config data. <!> NOT TESTED <!>
Start-up screen shows a warning message if EEPROM is faulty or not fitted.

Added "auto-detect" function for OLED display.  
No need to tie button inputs to GND where OLED is not fitted.

v1.7.2  13-03-2025 -- WIP
`````````````````````````
Fixed a bug in EEPROM driver code -- But still more bug(s) in it!

Added option to use CV3 (EXPRN) input for "Velocity" when 'Ampld Ctrl Mode'
is set to 'ENV1 * Velo'. (Otherwise, velocity is constant 80% FS.)

v1.8  14-03-2025 -- WIP
`````````````````````````
Cosmetic changes to Home screen... icons, logos, etc.
Non-functional changes to Start-up screen (text).

All Setup Menu selections are available in any control mode (CV or MIDI).

v1.9  20-03-2025
````````````````
EEPROM driver code fixed. (Verified by JPM.)

v1.9.6  23-APR-2025 : Released on GitHub
````````````````````````````````````````
Fixed bug in MIDI input routine: Data Entry (Master Tune) message must be
preceded by Registered Param (01) message; else Data Entry msg ignored.


v2.0  30-MAY-2025 : Released on GitHub
``````````````````````````````````````
Added GATE signal 'de-bounce' function in case GATE input source is a manual 
push-button or other mechanical switch (with adverse contact bounce).

Changed 'Master Tune' param range, now -100 to +100 cents (+1/-1 semitone)
using control panel.  (MIDI range remains ±64 due to 7-bit data range.) 

Added feature to switch 'Legato Mode' ON or OFF via MIDI message CC68.
Added icon (^) to show 'Legato Mode' status in SETUP MENU screen (top LHS).
Presets 01 ~ 23 have Legato disabled when selected.
Presets 24 ~ 31 have Legato enabled when selected (to suit EWI controllers).

Modified MIDI input service routine. When Legato is OFF, the synth operates
in "Multi-Trigger" keying mode (to suit Polyphonic MIDI controllers).
[See project website for details.]

Modulation level is set at 50% whenever a preset is selected, in case there's 
no signal input (MIDI or CV) to vary the level while a note is playing.

Added configuration parameter 'CV Auto-switch' (value ON or OFF).
The parameter can be set ON or OFF in the Setup screen 'CV Options'.
If it is set 'ON', CV control mode will switch automatically between MIDI
and CV control when a MIDI Note-On msg or GATE signal is input (resp.).
If it is set 'OFF', CV control is disabled, allowing MIDI control only.

Modified CV input service routine. CV1 ADC readings are filtered (1st-order
IIR with K = 1/16) which causes a delay, hence unwanted 'glissando'.
The filter output variable is now reset to the instantaneous ADC reading every
time the GATE signal transitions from Low to High, to eliminate the annoying
glide from the last note playing to the new note.

Modified Start-up screen: 'Defualt' option (button B) not shown if EEPROM is 
faulty or not installed.
Added a firmware build option: #define EEPROM_IS_INSTALLED  {TRUE or FALSE}
Set this symbol FALSE if EEPROM is not installed so that the error message
'<!> EEPROM fault' does not appear on the Startup screen.  Instead, a warning
message 'No EEPROM support' will be displayed.

Refined instrument sounds in some presets. Total presets: 32.
